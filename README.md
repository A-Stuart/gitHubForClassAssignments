# Using git and GitHub for Class Assignments

Git is a version control system which runs on your computer. GitHub is an online location for creating and hosting remote repositories. ( https://github.com/ ) Version control systems and remote repositories were created for software development. However remote repositories like GitHub have become an easy way for programmers and other knowledge workers to share information. A great deal of teaching and learning materials are made widely available through GitHub repositories. This includes a lot of resources for statistics and data science. Since so much material you encounter online may be available through GitHub repositories and because online repositories make collaborating on work with other people so easy I have incorporated GitHub into the workflow for this course. We will be using GitHub in this course as a place where you can store your own copy of the assignments we will be completing. Rather than turn files in directly to our course software, you will upload your completed assignments to your GitHub repository for that assignment and turn in the link to your repository so I can go look at it there. I think this arrangement offers some benefits for everyone.

* You get an instaneous copy of the assignment in your own GitHub account.
* You will have access to your work from this class after this semester is over without a lot of work to archive it and put it online. It will be handy should you ever want to review it in the future.
* You will become familiar and more comfortable with how GitHub repositories work. Should you run across learning materials on GitHub in the future you will know how to access them and create your own copies.
* I can access your work quickly and easily using this method.

Since this is a statistics course and not a computer science course, I don't care if you have a deep knowledge of git. All you really need to know for this course is that it allows you to create copies of your GitHub repositories on your own computer. And when you make changes to files in your repositories which are linked to the remote version online, it can help you push those changes to your online version. If you want to learn more about the foundations and inner workings of git you can look through the Optional Material section at https://github.com/cmcntsh/compSci2021_Setup . (You don't need to do that for this class. I just provide the link in case you have interest.) Git started out as a command line program. We won't be using it that way in this course. But if you want to get a taste of how git works from the command line you can complete the exercises at https://github.com/cmcntsh/exerGitPractice . (You don't need to do that for this class. I just provide the link in case you have interest.)
